-- Question 1
-- Rewrite the example from the lesson that sums the two ages and uses the pass function, 
-- such that it will use the censor function instead. Notice how the type signatures of
-- the function sumAge gets simplified.

-- Question 2
-- Rewrite the example from the lesson that uses the listen function, when reading the
-- logs from the start function such that it will use the listens function instead.

-- Question 3
-- Write a program that asks the user for 2 integers and then computes their greatest
-- common divisor with Euclidâ€™s algorithm. The programm should also write out the steps
-- that the algorithm is performing. Use a Writer monad to acomplis this.

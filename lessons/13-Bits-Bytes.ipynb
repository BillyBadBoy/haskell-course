    "## Grouping bits and bytes\n",
    "At its core computers only handle the binary object 1 and 0, this unit is also known as a **bit**. To make sense of these bits and extract context from them, different kinds of grouping have been made over the years to represent structure, for an extensive list see [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding). These groupings are called **encodings** and map the grouping of bits to a more meaningful/readable form. Another advantage of this mapping is that the length of a list of bits can be reduced significantly to be readable. Below we will look at two of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful binary conversion is the hexadecimal encoding of bits, also abbreviated to hex. This changes the number of symbols from base 2 (binary) to base 16. So, the conversion will group 4 bits together to one symbol. Each symbol in the hex system thus has 16 possibilities, these are in the range of 0-9 and A - F.  This results in the conversion table. \n",

    "In its turn, the hexadecimal encoded bits often get grouped together in pairs to represent 8 bits. The grouping of 8 bits is also called a **byte** and is more commonly used than bits. The result is that the range of these two grouped hex symbols are between `00000000` and `11111111` in binary. In total, these represent the decimal number from 0 to 255. Below is an example how to use hex and binary from the decimal system. We can use it to check the table above."

    "Another important encoding that connects computer bits with text and is widely used, is the 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8). This standard represents Unicode characters in 1 to 4 bytes, depending on the character. The reason why this encoding uses a variable length of bytes to represent its characters, is because not every character is used that often. To optimize for data transmissions times and storage space, only the most used characters are represented with one byte. The next most used characters are then represented with 2 bytes etc."

    "## Haskell, bytes and encodings\n",
    "In Haskell, we have several types that capture the encoding of characters and their representation as bytes. We will introduce a few below that are of importance. We start with the lowest structure that has no encoding, the type `ByteString`. This is a list of bytes that, given context, can be viewed as multiple things. We will look at two common ways, \n",

    "| a list of type `Char` | This type tries to decode the list of bytes as 1 byte Unicode character.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a string to a byte string, we can use the function `pack` in the `Data.ByteString` module. As an example, consider the two ways of representing a byte string above and how they are printed to standard output. First, we convert a string to a byte string using the `pack` function. Then we `unpack` this byte string as two things, as a list of bytes, and as a list of characters with `unpack` from the `Char8` module. Lastly, we print the object of these lists to the output. We explicitly imported both modules with an alias because both contain clashing named functions, like the two `unpack` functions used. This is also the reason why we import the modules `qualified`, this force us to specify from which module we pick which function. We will talk more about qualified imports in lesson Pragmas, Modules and Cabal."

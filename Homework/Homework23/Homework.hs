Question 1
Write a program for creating a shopping list, where the user can add 3 kinds of
flowers. When the program is started it should display the following message:
    Possible flowers are: daisy, sunflower and tulip.
    Possible actions are:
        add  --flower --amount 
        remove --flower --amout 
        show_list 
If the user does not use a valid comamnd and appropriate options notify him about
this. When the user says show_list print a message of how many of which flowers are
added to the list. Use a state monad when coding the solution.
